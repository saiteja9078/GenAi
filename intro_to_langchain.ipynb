This problem is still present today but far less prominent as the SotA models generalize much better and, in the case of MRKL, are able to use tools relatively well (although we could certainly take the MRKL solution to improve tool use performance even today).\n",

The article suggests that the long-term future of **AGI** may evolve from agentic systems.\\n2.  AI agents are defined as any **neuro-symbolic** system in which neural AI is merged with semi-traditional software.\\n3.  With agents, LLMs can integrate with **code**, allowing them to search the web, perform math, and integrate into anything we can build.\\n4.  **Neuro-symbolic** systems consist of both neural and symbolic computation.\\n5.  **Symbolic** AI is the more traditional approach, believing true AGI could be achieved via written rules and ontologies.\\n6.  **Connectionism** emerged in 1943 with a theoretical neural circuit and truly kicked off with Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron paper in 1958.\\n7.  Neural systems are good at flexible, **learned** logic, while symbolic systems excel at granular, fine-tuned rules.\\n8.  Neural systems require huge amounts of **data** and **compute** to train, while code is relatively cheap to write and update.\\n9.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is commonly used to provide LLMs with up-to-date knowledge on a particular subject or access to proprietary knowledge.\\n10. In 2022, researchers at AI21 developed **Jurassic-X**, an LLM-based \"neuro-symbolic architecture.\"\\n11. The researchers developed **MRKL** to solve the limitations of LLMs, namely lack of up-to-date knowledge, proprietary knowledge, reasoning, and ability to generalize.\\n12. **MRKL** represents one of the earliest forms of what we would now call an agent; it is an LLM paired with executable code.\\n13. The **ReAct** method encourages LLMs to generate iterative reasoning and action steps.\\n14. During the reasoning step, the LLM describes what **steps** are to be taken to answer the user\\'s query.\\n15. The ReAct loop continues until the LLM has enough **information** to answer the original input.\\n16. Besides ReAct and Tool agents, alternative agent structures include multi-agent workflows, deterministic workflows, and **embedding** models that can detect user intents.'"
